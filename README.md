## *About Me*

I'm a statistician, educator, and graduate student currently pursuing an M.S. in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago.
Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities where I can merge my technical skills and teaching experience to drive progress at the intersection of data, learning, and well-being.

Living with a heart condition has deeply influenced my passion and commitment to healthcare and statistics in hospital environments.
Itâ€™s given me a first-hand view of the importance of data-informed analyses and decisions in medicine as a matter of personal experience and daily life.
This motivates me to pursue analytical solutions and to build data science systems which prioritize both accuracy and empathy,
with the goal of improving care for individuals as well as easing the cognitive and administrative burdens placed on clinicians.

My experience as a teacher in both mathematics and German has reinforced my belief in the power of data literacy and cross-cultural communication.
Whether through statistical modeling, collaborative problem-solving, or multilingual engagement, I strive to make complex data insights both accessible and actionable.
I'm also a lifelong musician, which fuels my creativity and discipline.

## *Projects*

#### [Reinforcement Learning-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Unifying Clinical Imaging and Text Retrieval](https://github.com/johnmelel/Capstone) | Capstone, Mar 2025 - Present
- Proposed and developed a multi-agent AI system that utilizes reinforcement learning and integrates with a centralized multimodal vector store to deliver dynamic, accurate, and timely clinical decision support.
- Developed with a team as part of the MS-ADS Research Capstone: GPT in Healthcare for the radiology team at the University of Chicago Medicine.

#### [Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction Prediction](https://github.com/sammtzk/Heart-Ejection-Fraction) | Bayesian Machine Learning, Jan 2025 - Mar 2025
- Constructed a proof-of-concept Bayesian-informed data science pipeline for heart health diagnosis by predicting the ejection fraction of the left ventricle (LVEF).
- Leveraged OpenCV and ResNet-18 transfer learning for feature extraction from echocardiogram video data in order to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for latent state space segmentation.
- Applied regression techniques to generate an estimate for LVEF informed by the distribution of hidden states identified with our HM model.
